  abstract = {Quadratic residue is an important concept in number theory because it has both theoretical and practical application in mathematics and other areas such as computer science and communication. We also have a same concept of quadratic residue in general finite fields. Finding a square root of a quadratic residue in finite fields is an essential problem in computational algebra. In this paper we present an algorithm of computing square root of quadratic residue in finite fields using a primitive element.},

  abstract = {The main objective of the research is the analysis of the practical applicability of the cryptographically secure software Blum-Blum-Shub pseudo-random number generator for different authentication and encryption tasks. It is shown that the considered pseudo-random sequence generator, which has a high computational complexity, can be effectively used in those cryptographic tasks, which require low key generation rate. An alternative way of implementing the Password-Based Key Derivation Function, which is based on the use of the Blum-Blum-Shub generator as a pseudo-random function, is proposed. The proposed algorithm allows to slow down dictionary and brute-force attacks. Experimental studies have shown that the developed algorithm allows to adaptively adjust the guaranteed minimum time of generating a cryptographic key for specific tasks of authentication and encryption.},
